# 🧠 Python Programming Assessment

This repository contains Python solutions to a series of programming challenges categorized by core concepts: **Functions**, **Lists**, **Tuples**, **Dictionaries**, and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. Each section progresses from easy to hard difficulty levels and includes clear test cases.
